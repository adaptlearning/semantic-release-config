# Adapt semantic-release-config

Shared [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) configuration and reusable GitHub Actions workflow for adapt-authoring modules.

## What's included

- **Shared config** (`index.js`) — commit analyzer and release notes using the [ESLint preset](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-eslint), plus npm, GitHub, and git plugins
- **Reusable workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — a GitHub Actions workflow that runs semantic-release on push to the default branch

## Setup

### 1. Install the config package

```bash
npm install --save-dev @adaptlearning/semantic-release-config
```

### 2. Add release config to `package.json`

Replace any inline `release` config with:

```json
{
  "release": {
    "extends": "@adaptlearning/semantic-release-config"
  }
}
```

### 3. Use the reusable workflow

Replace your `.github/workflows/releases.yml` with:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  release:
    uses: adaptlearning/semantic-release-config/.github/workflows/release.yml@master
```

We use trusted publishing for npm, see below for more details.

### 4. Remove redundant devDependencies

The following are now provided by this package and can be removed from your `devDependencies`:

- `semantic-release`
- `@semantic-release/git`
- `conventional-changelog-eslint`

## Trusted publishing

Trusted publishing lets GitHub Actions publish to npm without long-lived access tokens. Instead, npm verifies the identity of the GitHub Actions workflow using OpenID Connect (OIDC). This means no `NPM_TOKEN` secret to manage or rotate, and published packages include a provenance attestation linking them back to the exact source commit and workflow run.

### GitHub repo setup

The reusable workflow already includes the required permissions — no additional configuration is needed in your repo. The relevant settings in the workflow are:

- `id-token: write` — allows the workflow to request an OIDC token
- `contents: write` — allows semantic-release to create tags and GitHub releases

### npm package setup

Each npm package needs to be linked to its GitHub repo on npmjs.com:

1. Go to **npmjs.com** > your package > **Settings** > **Publishing access**
2. Under **Trusted publishing**, click **Add new provider**
3. Configure the provider:
   - **Registry**: `GitHub Actions`
   - **Repository owner**: the GitHub org (e.g. `adapt-security`)
   - **Repository name**: the repo name (e.g. `adapt-authoring-core`)
   - **Workflow filename**: `releases.yml`
4. Save — the package can now only be published by the matching workflow
